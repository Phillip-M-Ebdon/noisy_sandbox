# Noisy Sandbox

This is a small hobby project of mine where I implent a noise algorithm of some sort and give controls to play with the output visual.

The algorithms are so far implemented myself, and as such are not optimised for performance, but rather my own understanding.

Current algorithms include:
- Perlin Noise
- Simplex Noise
- Worley Noise (Interface WIP)
