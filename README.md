# Noisy Sandbox

hosted here: https://noisey-sandbox.herokuapp.com/

This is a small hobby project of mine where I implent a noise algorithm of some sort and give controls to play with the output visual.

The algorithms are so far implemented myself, and as such are not optimised for performance, but rather my own understanding.

Current algorithms include:
- Perlin Noise
- Simplex Noise
- Worley Noise (Interface WIP)

Currently the project is hosted on Heroku, letting me serve the HTML and JS with Express.
